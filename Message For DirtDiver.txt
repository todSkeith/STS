Pretty please can you make sure the game isnt broken before you commit anything to the git?  I got on today and tested everything out and was left with an absolutely broken game.  

I could not even get past the lobby.  I don't like reverting your work because I know you work just as hard as I do.  You dont have to have it working and finished, just make sure that everything else that was working still works before committing.  

Jonsandman has all the files that you committed before I rolled them back, and I did my best to pick a rollback that didn't delete your roadcones and stuff

Sorry for the trouble, we really need to link up and get on the same page
